## Manager of Software Development
### Wolters Kluwer
Irving TX // 2017 - Present

Improving team dynamics, Agile maturity, and product ownership have been the major accomplishments for the team over the last year. Early on it was discovered, by gathering data through 1:1's and team meetings, that the team needed to grow in their Agile maturity and ownership. Every Product Increment (SAFe cadence) the team was encouraged to focus on one new major implementation related to Agile. These Agile practices were further reinforced in 1:1's, Iteration Retrospectives, and micro-experiments. Team dynamics were improved using tools from Management 3.0 -- CHAMPFROGS, Moving Motivators, Happiness Door, STAR-AR (modified), Personal Maps, etc. -- as well as just good old-fashioned fun! This year we're focused on unmasking the mystery of our legacy source code through a Scooby-Doo-themed initiative called "The Mystery Machine!"

## Manager of Software Development
### eMortgage Logic an Assurant Company
N. Richland Hills TX // 2012 - 2016

Managed and grew a team of UI/UX engineers, backend engineers (LAMP; P = 'Perl'), and production support agents in the development and support of an enterprise SaaS property valuation platform. The platform was customer-facing, used internally, and licensed to Fannie Mae. Reporting directly to CIO, I recruited, hired, and promoted the growth of software engineers resulting in improving production, quality and efficiency of development and our software. I introduced modern testing techniques (Protractor for Angular 1.x, Siesta for ExtJS, Selenium, and Sauce Labs) to allow for automated cross-browser compatibility testing as part of development and the release pipeline. I expanded performance analytics to include the implementation of Dynatrace. I introduced an MVP approach to development (following Lean UX principles) utilizing beta testing, usability testing, analytics, and quick feedback loops. Additionally, I implemented and evangelized Agile methodologies across the organization.
